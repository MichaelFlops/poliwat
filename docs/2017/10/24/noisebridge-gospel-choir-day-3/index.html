<p>Ran to caltrain carrying 30 pounds across two packs and a plate of pasta. Barely made it!</p>

<p>Spent the morning writing for the choir</p>

<p>The hole in my intestines deepened at the purchase of another train ticket on my credit card.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing music as if my life depended on it.</p>

<p>How can I do this quicker?</p>

<p>Writing the voicings using just simple operator in Ableton, quantizing, then importing that midi to musescore. That will be how I write the choral piece. I want it to be just choir and an 808 in a sampler that I play. So I play along to a choir. Wish I brought my keys but already brought a shit ton of gear. Had a ball on the breadboard yesterday - Kevin at noisebridge gave me one of his Ultrasonic sensors and I got it working within the hour. Ultimately it&rsquo;s going to be my octave switch, holding out my arm at 12 inches and under will go down and holding my arm past 12 inches will go up. Like a switch. Or it could be a pitch bend on the entire thing.</p>

<p>But first I need to write a script that takes the distance and changes the hue of the LED first.
Like Paul said, the path to success is small steps.</p>

<p>-=-=-</p>

<p><em>251 pM</em></p>

<p>If I have lost a cable, look around my neck</p>

<pre><code>
// led test in beginning of each program to tell me it's running
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // set the LED on

</code></pre>

<p>at this terrible place called workpress cafe or something.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday 1043 PM</em></p>

<p>NB and TSS auditions went well.</p>

<p>Cam and I worked at workcafe and I came up with how I&rsquo;m going to make a 1 hour radio play.</p>

<p>Feels good to crack the seal on this caltrain.</p>

<p>Asim my new mentor invited me on our first date. Ahahahaha not that kind of date. A circuit trade show expo thing in Santa Clara. I hope to get some freebie arduino goodies. Though it&rsquo;s going to be lower level than that. Sort of like a peak of my future for the next iteration of poliwat (using FSRs). Tomorrow morning Asim will text me if its cool.</p>

<p>Had a blast on ubuweb after I got a basic analog midi device working with the teensy 3.0. It wasn&rsquo;t the sort of place to bring out a breadboard, but I did nonetheless. I like working on hardware for a some new reasons. For example, the goals I set can be attained usually within the hour. You&rsquo;re sort of hyperaware of progress. Also, I like getting proven wrong all along the way. Asim said I should draw out a schematic for poliwat. I will after drawing a smaller schematic for a MIDI controller to use with Ableton.</p>

<p>The process of doing this smaller project will give me the skills needed to tackle the 70+ connections project consistently. I need to design this well because I&rsquo;m rough with electronics. I push all my electronics to the max, in a sort of abusive way. Everyone&rsquo;s different. The limits is where I like it. The point of convergence. Listening to str8 from the hospital that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s making me write this way. Super.</p>

<p><em>-=- Wednesdays 1226 AM</em></p>

<p>jack showed me sky for the first time and she&rsquo;s got disco pop down. But I wonder if her lyrics are any good.</p>

<pre><code>[Verse 1]
Poured myself a warm glass, and laid awake (10)
I prayed the Lord my soul to take (8)

I thought about you all day (7)
How we have the same face (6)
I fell asleep so confused (7)
Parts of me remind me of you (8)
How could I ever wish away? (8)

[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you (13)
And standing in the water with me ()
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream

[Verse 2]
I wake up and I hear my phone ring
I hear your call and I let my phone ring
When I got into my car and drove away
I listened to the stereo play

I live by my own laws
Stick to my guns and hold my head up to the midnight sun
I hope the guilt will dim and fade
A fire baptism engulfed in my shame

[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
And I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
And I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream
