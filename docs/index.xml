      <description>Just jumped in the ocean and practiced handstands. This guy showed me how to go from your butt to a handstand There are different types of breathing.
 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.</description>

      <description>take death in pride
My cat died a few a couple months ago. It occurred around the time that %^&amp;amp;#$% broke up with me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about it since, but being home the past few days I was reminded how much I missed her. { The cat, not my X }

I got her though  this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what key this is. I&amp;rsquo;m tone deaf.</description>

      <description>had 2 beers last night Currently working on a trap song with lyrics exploring the perspective of not being born yet, and not necessarily wanting to be born. Since you&amp;rsquo;re constrained to the reality of our politics, biology, and paradigms; such as religion, capitalism, etc.
current state  I got the idea at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house, when I took an image of her sonogram and ran it through a max msp patch that converted the image data to MIDI.</description>

      <description>300 gigs of my own personal audio recordings. Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&amp;rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&amp;rsquo;t stop. Strong words have been tossed between friends and family, and every once in a while someone tries to speak against it.</description>

      <description>the center of github
 I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling.</description>

Had 1 beer @ [jack&amp;rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.</description>

      <description>I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</description>
