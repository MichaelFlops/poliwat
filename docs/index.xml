Sitting in the trailer on our property on the mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s dirty, needs new apolstery and has a mushroom growing on the inside above the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve never lived in a trailer before. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to wallow in existential, cause that kills time.
I like the sounds here. There&amp;rsquo;s two crows having a distinct conversation. I need to calm down. I woke up with a lot of pressure in my head.</description>

I played a live set at the third fern gully installment, it was sweet.
I britney spears&amp;rsquo;d it. I made a 30 min music video / ableton mix. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any live looping like I wanted but did had a nice ratio of 40% written and 60% freestyle throughout the set.
The reception was real next level - people really loved that shit. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely on to something I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to.</description>

I saw a bent nail sticking out the the brick wall, and touched it. Then while inspecting the wall at large, I found a small crack 8 inches and two the left of my face.

      <description>Kantas Pri Disciplino (aka chants for discpline)
June 13th 2018 on a hot summer day
This is the first of my chant series. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to imporve discipline, and have found great results by chanting in other ways.
So next time I&amp;rsquo;m in the field, and hit the wall but need to continue, then I can use this chant.
Each word of the chant is a human&amp;rsquo;s name that showed an immense amount of perseverance and discipline in their lives.</description>

Why do I record?
There&amp;rsquo;s a few reasons.
In a composer&amp;rsquo;s mindset, everything is an instrument. Humans are instruments
and I like getting them to sing, open up

From a composer mindset, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to think of instrument

My granny&amp;rsquo;s hometown. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go there.
I walked home in about an hour and 30 from campus, listening to tape from yesterday and reading 12 rules for life.
The only reason I have jordan peterson&amp;rsquo;s book is because Bean happened to have it and she brought it over. Cas Katie Celia Simone came over at 9 with a live chicken and we took it to the chapel.</description>

I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;ve gotten so high so often. But that&amp;rsquo;s what trap inspires. trap gods are powered by cannibis. It&amp;rsquo;s cannibus inspired music.

Alright my logs have sucked dick. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. Since the party I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like paryting. I just want to work on my shit, though that&amp;rsquo;s a party in a way.
Am I lonely?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m exhibiting behavior on account of being lonely, or stressed.</description>

      <description>#newsong concept:
gregor mendel was celebit his whole life - but the whole reason he loved breeding plants was because he was a homosexual. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t be gay back then so he redirected his homo desires into plants.
But it took one special night to start doing this.
And he was a conflicted priest for a few years, and then one summer night snuck out and hit the city for the weekend.</description>

@ diridon - hitting palo alto to grab my phone from Avery and upload a bunch of old stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m going to upload most of this hard drive.

A solid morning.
Caputed by the buddhists, I asked if it was church and Tracy laughed and told me it&amp;rsquo;s more of a meeting.

Got sweet audio of a little lecture presentation by a grad student at the ackman lab on campus at UCSC. It&amp;rsquo;ll be in PDB.
The site is going well I really need to keep the hackathon grind on.
But just saw Lena, a sweet ass astrophysics girl that I met in the electronic music studio last year. I want to record her talking about her classes, she has a great passion for it</description>

Charging the Go Pro. I broke so many audio laws this past week, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what to do with myself. At this point in time I have lost about 3 micro sd cards which has all the best tape from the last 1-2 weeks.</description>

Monday 12:13 PM
Find myself on the 17 again. No headphones today because I want to just hear everything. I went overboard on music the past week, and one of the mushroom nights I went down the rabbit hole imagining that I disrecpected music for too long, and now am paying the price for it. It&amp;rsquo;s all made up. Super cute girl walking by outside.</description>

Well now it&amp;rsquo;s :59&amp;hellip;
Really going through a rut&amp;hellip;
I can&amp;rsquo;t admit what&amp;rsquo;s happening even in poliwat.
The key to naviagting with reality is to not care. Not care in a sense that you&amp;rsquo;re able to allow eveything to happen to you.
Poliwat is the one way I can organize my mind, and ensure that I&amp;rsquo;m on the right path. Yesterday I attempted to smoke as much weed as I possibly could.</description>

In the first hour of hanging out with this old indian dude in the sun by the jacoozi, I got a real sad spell. I became attached to him too quick, and thought how he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much time left. It made me so sad, because the light in him shines brighter than anyone I&amp;rsquo;ve seen here.
We shared a spliff and talked about everything. He affirmed that life is but a stage.</description>

I submitted to darkness, the past few days have been a blur. I wasted Monday-now. But I had a real nice time having a solid hangout session with Darlene, we hiked around my house and I showed her classified liC. Addy fucked me so hard I have wanted to kill myself consistently since Sunday. Also Matt was the worst house guest, but he just got out of a relationship with Kim after 4 1&amp;frasl;2 years so it&amp;rsquo;s understandable.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s my Bday.
I have a glorious 1 hour off and it feel amazing.
This has been my first week working as a Naturalist. I love it so much! The kids are great, yesterday after we caught salamanders, they all held out their hands for diet hot cheetos (which are carrots). And I threw them all over them, and they landed in the dirt. Then the kids joined the super secret dirty carrot club, and they took turns throwing dirty carrots into my mouth to eat.</description>

@ starbucks, got a ride from Niko to Los Gatos, now I&amp;rsquo;ll splurge the 18 bucks for a lyft to get to the station. I&amp;rsquo;m not making any money after it&amp;rsquo;s all said and done, but getting 50 bucks to record a podcast is still great cause it pays for transportation and food for the day, and I get to edit my audio the rest of the day.</description>

On the stage at my new house. The last 48 hours was insane! I spent 101 buck at grocery outlet, and have been at my house all weekend. Spent from dawn to the time I passed on music yesterday. Made about 30 minutes of radio. Pretty fast pace, my workflow has gotten much faster.
however the inner junky in me won, and I day drank smoked and did some extra credit drugs as well.</description>

Sitting in my new room. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any decorating yet, and have been sleeping on a sleeping pad / bag combo the past two nights. It&amp;rsquo;s been swell, with a tinge of freaking out. I haven&amp;rsquo;t vocalized my freakout among friends, we were too busy having a fun time.
Just got off the phone with SR, it looks like they liked me at camp enough to include me for more dates!</description>

@ Peter&amp;rsquo;s cafe right at the milbrae station. Got a ride from my new buddy Kiev to the North Berkeley BART, he got off at 16th and mission to hit the city with old college friends.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather pay 10 bucks and sit at this cafe while waiting the hour for the caltrain over taking a taxi, this is much nicer. Then I get to be on my laptop for both.</description>

Way too excited right now to be productive. I&amp;rsquo;m terrified to look at my bank account. But I did just get paid.
CAMP WAS SO FUN There&amp;rsquo;s so many cool people here, it&amp;rsquo;s unreal. About to get a ride from Kiev to San Fran, where I&amp;rsquo;ll probably jump on Caltrain (or hang with gusTedCam for a few hours), where I&amp;rsquo;ll deep clean.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s all about, clean moving and applying for 3 places:</description>

Slept in the theatre last night with pero. The whole TSS crew did tech rehearsal until like 3 AM - so matt and I just crashed there. It was a good move, cause I was able to wake up early, drive over and buy a go pro hero 4 off Kyle from letgo, and get some footage. Had a nice talk with a man at a lablabyrinthrythnh outside some real nice cathedral close to Pine street.</description>

FIRE AUDIO!!!! Been getting great clips around here.
Had a nice V day in SC. Me Ian and Nick made a beat.
Last night I walked down to the stage at midnight last night. I started a little fire but put it out cause there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much good firewood around.
This morning I was waiting at the bus stop but a dude came driving by in a forerunner, so I hitched a ride with him.</description>

went from trimming in boulder creek, to lasering @NB, to meeting up with Manny at 2:30 AM and hanging out with him until 5, then sleeping in my car, then hitting NB all day, then Y session with Jack, then drove to Avery&amp;rsquo;s, we practiced our set, smoked and took choomies for our live performance on day of noise.</description>

On Caltrain, heading to meet cam. We&amp;rsquo;re getting haircuts today! The plumber that came this morning was talking to Jack&amp;rsquo;s mom about moving within the next year. He placed the house at about 2.3 million, where I&amp;rsquo;m crashing. In a late night episode, I was looking up the prices of places in CA, and San Mateo it about the 3rd most expensive place in the state.

4 all nighters in a row; today has been a blur at best. Had a nice little practice with Jack in the local park close to his house.
The application for this grad program is due Feb 14th, basically a week from now because I need to mail it.
That puts me in a little bit of a time crunch.
Tonight is a media night!

to all the people that said I wouldn&#39;t amount to anything I still havent given up  3 all nighters in a row, going on 4 tonight.
I am v stressed cause I did a solid first episode for my radio show,
and the thing is,
when you do something abnormally good,
you need to do better that next week,
so I won&amp;rsquo;t sleep much
luckily the sound library provides and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to stress about getting tape</description>

You&amp;rsquo;re listening to the first episode of pale blue dawt
tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode is more of a human collage of sound and music,
all sounds are from my sound library,
with music sprinkled over real people, living real lives,
This is billed as a talk show, however the people speaking are augmented with music

I&amp;rsquo;m going to try something new. Instead of getting high, I will do something new. Looking over the past month I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to regulate substances, and have been made noticeable improvement. I have now made it about 5 days since my last tobacco hit and so I may be in the clear. It&amp;rsquo;s been hard at times being around many friends with countless substance opportunities.</description>

Oops, I did it again. Had a great 2 days in SC with shiba, shubat, ariel, stefan, dani, and too many more. Great catchup with Dibs, we went to tap and walked all around the city.

So last night my cousin R called me. He&amp;rsquo;s a military guy on the east coast. We had the most HILARIOUS and loving short talk, best tape of my life. I was recording but had the gain on the mic at 0, so I got none of it.
These are are the moments you become used to when chasing tape. Cause tape can&amp;rsquo;t be chased. You can only set the parameters of the situation, that&amp;rsquo;s when the best tape occurs.</description>

Best YT comment I&amp;rsquo;ve seen AHAHAHA
I&#39;ve been programming for 19 years. People think creating AI with self modifying code is really difficult when the development of AI has only been limited by CPU power. Its actually quite easy, that&#39;s why its so scary. Genetic Algorithms are mostly a copy paste job, the only programming that is required is figuring out the heuristic. They are extremely simple by virtue of the fact that it can basically start with nothing and will always eventually get the result you want in a semi brute force fashion, the only factor is time.</description>

Dear parents,
I declare myself in a state of emergency!
I have managed to shower, eat well, work and play so far. Today is day 1 of complete sobriety.
We are having this meeting because you expressed concern. That&amp;rsquo;s great! Because I could really use some help.
One must listen before they help, so I wrote down an overview of my work.
I feel overwhelmed, and you will soon see why.</description>

Haven&amp;rsquo;t written much in poliwat because I started a secret project I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about. I&amp;rsquo;m publishing a book anonymously, it has 10,000 words so far. Wrote it all in one all nighter last Friday night. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ll say about it.
The piano has been drinking. The audio I got yesterday:
2-3 people moved my recorder while it was in place. Ahahahaha too bad.

On Caltrain heading to Aren&amp;rsquo;s talk. Listening to Avery&amp;rsquo;s mixes.
I got great tape last night but can&amp;rsquo;t share it on here. After Asim dropped me back home from NB at abou 1130PM, I realized I left my lappy. He picked my dumbass up a second time and we drove all the way back to grab it, because in his words &amp;ldquo;You told me your laptop was your life&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 Asim picked me up from Stanford after I got a little tape reading TSS, and on our way to NB he took me to a place called Scrap, and it was fucking sick.
Purchased the case for my new Midi controller, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be made using the extra parts I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated. I&amp;rsquo;m drawing out the schematic and laser cutting wood for the thing. In a 3D printing / Modeling class here at NB and it&amp;rsquo;s about to get started.</description>

Spent the morning writing for the choir
The hole in my intestines deepened at the purchase of another train ticket on my credit card.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing music as if my life depended on it.
How can I do this quicker?
Writing the voicings using just simple operator in Ableton, quantizing, then importing that midi to musescore.</description>

Waiting for caltrain
Talked with my sister and we 3 way called my mom, trying to schedule a time to help dad clean out the garage while I was there. I wanted to show Bonnie and my dad the app Letgo (the new craigslist) so they could easily get rid of stuff and make a couple bucks on the side.
My mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t having it and said she didn&amp;rsquo;t want issues with me so I hung up on them.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a slow start, but well done.
Listening to the Modern Architect, a show I may help produce at KZSU. I&amp;rsquo;ll see their process on Thursday and see what&amp;rsquo;s up. http://www.themodernarchitect.org/on-demand-episodes
God saved me because someone off of letgo bought my loaded longboard deck. When I&amp;rsquo;m rich I&amp;rsquo;ll get one again.
Last night auditions went well - but I am getting off topic lately. Last night I went all out into a Davinci resolve editing tutorial, because Rob recommended I try to forget about premiere and final cut.</description>

This is the new me. Made everything on my soundcloud private except for the Marquettequette album so my family can hear it.
I have 1 new deadline. 1 track a week, to be released every Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Other than that I am looking good.
4 cute Spanish women want to hangout tonight in the city at bars, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should go.

      <description>media gets Fragmented
A speaker tells a listener what someone did to get what he wanted and why.
Once a character has a desire, the story &amp;ldquo;walks&amp;rdquo; on two &amp;ldquo;legs&amp;rdquo;: acting and learning. A character pursuing a desire takes actions to get what he wants, and he learns new information about better ways to get it. Whenever he learns new information, he makes a decision and changes his course of action.</description>

I woke up from 3 bad dreams on the trampoline. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling quite lonely. My dad is cursing and is angry about being late to work. The moment he comes home from his job he turns off and veggetizes. We rarely play music together.
Why should I feel depressed? I successfully launched two sites and applied to about 30 jobs yesterday.</description>

I have to have to be honest. Other than logging an audio trail, this diary is a tool for me to make better decisions. It was MONDAY when I started my portfolio site, and now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here and it&amp;rsquo;s late Thursday morning. I woke up on the trampoline falling asleep to Joe Rogon and Neil de Grasse Tyson. At about 1:20:50 Tyson talks about the importance of the naming of stuff, which clearly explains to me why the Illest Village project works.</description>

Last night I planted some iceplant Paul gave me in my parents backyard. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to plant on the side.
This morning started with a quick look into Samuel Beckett and three Jays. JK, not marijuana but James Joyce, and Jane Austin.
Quick nugs from School of life and my own understanding:
Sammuel Beckett  likes to write around the word &#39;perhaps&#39; not specific, allowing viewer to make it specific on their own  James Joyce  Everyday losers are just as epic and interesting as rich / heroes / heroines.</description>

Sammuel Beckett  likes to write around the word &#39;perhaps&#39; not specific, allowing viewer to make it specific on their own  James Joyce  Everyday losers are just as epic and interesting as rich / heroes / heroines.</description>

Just waking up. I ate my dad&amp;rsquo;s unfinished cereal with mangos, bananas, and strawberries in it.
The 7 Hermetic Principles  “THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental.”
 “As above, so below; as below, so above.”
 “Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.”
 “Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.</description>

With my parental units, we are on our way to Bonnie&amp;rsquo;s Birthday dinner at a restaurant named Ember.
My parents watch master chef and eat mcdonalds.
So past 24 hours of poliwat venturing.
 Sean took me to his dad&amp;rsquo;s shop. We opened jars of screws and found enough for at least half the mounting brackets for the sliders / effects racks.   Borrowed a self-powered breadboard from Sean in order to diagnose LEDS, as well as two books on solid state electronics.</description>

I must admit here that I could be going faster. But I got distracted by the school of life&amp;rsquo;s art and Architecture educational videos on youtube.
Good design:[10]  is innovative – The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</description>

 Poliwat master doc is getting an update.
1232 PM
Only listening to Bach because we share a birthday. Ate a quick tri-tip sandwich with a pickle, and made one for my mom.
Since today the world is ending, the only sane task at hand is to do what I love. I will build poliwat, and then travel the world with it. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple though because although the code compiles, I can&amp;rsquo;t get anything out of the LCD screen at the moment&amp;hellip;</description>

Woke up very depressed
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to move to San Mateo today. The plan is to start with getting a credit card at Wells Fargo, so I can rent the uhaul. You can&amp;rsquo;t rent a uhaul without a credit card. Then I just have to pack up whats in my room and head up there. But really I&amp;rsquo;d rather turn off my phone, keep my blinds shut, and work on poliwat.</description>

“Nowadays, the prevailing view is that you should authentically rejoice and celebrate the spiritual happiness that this era has to offer, for it is a gift! People need to think about how many challenges the world has faced and how many obstacles and dreadful dangers it has overcome. They no longer believe that it is temporal distance that embellishes things, persons and situations and what makes difficulties and problems fade away and be forgotten.</description>

      <description>I discovered one of the biggest thrills.
But first I will begin with the start of the night, at an old engineer type friend named Thomas from back in my Community College days. He held the BBQ at a house real close to one of the elementary schools I went to. It was interesting because I remember doing motocross as a kid with a friend that used to live there. There used to be a huge nice dirt motocross track in the backyard, but it had since been bulldozed.</description>

We were joking the other night and Chad said a good one &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so broke my most broke friend said I was broke&amp;rdquo;
When you are this broke you can see price tags on all your possessions. I made a pact to sell anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t related to Poliwat.</description>

Moving and cleaning the room Day 2, very deep in it.
Moving gives you an air of sentiment. There are great as well as painful memories, and they&amp;rsquo;re all treasured.

Captured memories is a main quest in Zelda. You need to find these 12(or 13?) lost memories across the expansive regions of the game.
Operation Captured Memories is the new official code name for the time capsule that we are burying at a graveyard in a couple weeks. So far this is what the box has:
 graduation certificiate from UCSC (which I&amp;rsquo;ll write a letter to my future self on) yoshi model from Mcdonalds little note I left for Tara (Jordan Lipaz&amp;rsquo;s GF) when I visited her trailer at the trailer park  &amp;lt;!</description>

      <description>Saturday 515 PM
Mom is babysitting Mila for the first time. She likes Raggae
It&amp;rsquo;s time to go back online. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sick since Monday, and still have a nasty cough. I feel weak and fat.
Going to retroactively share what happened on the off days, and finally work on poliwat.
My Zelda botw binge has been relentless. I love storming Ganon&amp;rsquo;s castle and hunting down lynels. I want to make a music video with actual gameplay on something.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting stuck on Ashley&amp;rsquo;s Photography work. I can&amp;rsquo;t look away! If she had a genre of photos I would call it sexy magic. She exploits the setting around these people to look much more attractive and magical than they&amp;rsquo;re probably treated. The hopeless romantic in me says the magic and beauty are already there, while she uses photography to show and remind others of it.
Future tracks will have track art from Ashley and will be notated as such.</description>

Haven&amp;rsquo;t written much because life has been too good.
In the car with Kevin and chad, we&amp;rsquo;re hitting paul&amp;rsquo;s b day!!!!
Very excited.
I took a bath in a horse troph in my parents backyard. I got everyone I love all about jimmothy leary.
Last night a drunk guy stumbled upon us and it&amp;rsquo;s still hilarious.
Me leaving my new hard drive in santa cruz was a huge mistake, but it&amp;rsquo;ll work out</description>

other animals bond, but they don&amp;rsquo;t go bananas

So I ordered a quick lyft, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my passport which serves a dual function as my wallet, and made it up to campus. Angel told me however that I was too late but she could get me in for a deep cleaning at noon.</description>

      <description>Monday 345 AM It&amp;rsquo;s too early to think clearly. But I find myself wide awake at an hour where coffee is not easy to grab and without filters in my house. I lie in a pile of blankets on a sleeping bag in a white room furnished with only a music stand and a blue lightbulb hanging on the wall.
Yesterday was one of the best days of my life.</description>

      <description>Sunday 832 AM
Woke up early so I could get some work done. Katie&amp;rsquo;s coming by with a thermos full of coffee at 10. We will checkout the local graveyard I assume, but it&amp;rsquo;s up in the air.
Tripping out to Slyvia&amp;rsquo;s voice currently. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. One of the last tracks on our first album as Jimmothy Leary. There&amp;rsquo;s about 10 tracks in my iTunes. James and I spent a lot of time yesterday bouncing tracks and figuring out the order of the album.</description>

      <description>it feels good -16 days sober A quick analysis of an online journal. Currently there are less than 10 readers (the latest being a 71 year old woman) I&amp;rsquo;m finding that there are experiences that need to be documented, but are disadvantageous to write. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a good journal without the experiences that matter to me, so it&amp;rsquo;s a huge disservice to leave those experiences out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with simply hiding that content so I can find it at a later date easily but users won&amp;rsquo;t see it.</description>

Spoke with Peter on the phone about dreams.
I went to bounce hour at work, this 1 hour weekly pow-wow where you share what you&amp;rsquo;re working on or do a presentation. I told everyone about PoLIWAT and scheduled to present it on the 28th of September. That&amp;rsquo;s my deadline! To get a working mvp out. I&amp;rsquo;m moving out of SC in about a week, and originally called Peter to see if he&amp;rsquo;d be interested in helping me move out of my place.</description>

What can I say. Woke up on a beach by mad river. The sun shone through the fog, and I recorded this:
 Stefan Jack and I skinny dipped in the ocean. There was a fisherman right next to us who got disgusted and left. We had a hilarious and exciting breakfast in Arcata. I haven&amp;rsquo;t recorded much on account of dead batteries after the ocean.</description>

The Uber driver had some colorful ideas to share. I oblidged, why not?
The trip isn&amp;rsquo;t off to a great start :)
But I pumped out this with the uber audio I just got:
 Going to focus on organizing my sound library now. Oh and story of my life the lappy has a full tummy it needs to shit out bad tape.</description>

Called dad P Diddy he didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. But he texted me saying I probably stayed up all night. Not this time!
I walked to the abbey, this is my efficacy when the internet goes down:
why won&#39;t the internet work here at the abbey? nothing is working. What a waste of time computers and phones are so fucking stupid I only curse because I haven&#39;t had nicotine in a very long time.</description>

The 12 steps to better abs.
Abs Anonymous.
And it started because for years, I have been keeping tabs on others with the same name as me, Michael Betts. Mostly to feel better about myself, but also I have this fantasy where we can all start a think tank and solve the world&amp;rsquo;s issues. Or even better not solve them and make a show of our attempts.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop.
I&amp;rsquo;m a slave. I&amp;rsquo;m a slave to the beat. The family reunion trip changed my mindset.</description>

      <description>Sunday 1134 AM A golden rule of writing is to choose specific over vague. The drunk shaman would not appreciate my sharing about them online so I will be vague. You are unstoppable when you have a drunken shaman.
Instead of talking about it I&amp;rsquo;m working on a track. This is the master doc for lyrics and iterations on the music.

      <description>Another unfinished project, but the idea is
song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m angry.
I&amp;rsquo;m freestyling on this version. I was actually lying down on my back, in the dark.</description>

      <description>Friday 620 pm
Peter hasn&amp;rsquo;t called back again - I called him yesterday.
Chad said he was going to be home in 30 and we were going to walk the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs together. He never showed up and I&amp;rsquo;ve called 3 times. I&amp;rsquo;m very depressed. It&amp;rsquo;s day 2 of sobriety, and my only drug has been in how the day was spent. I worked on the Betts family renunion album from 8am - 6pm.</description>

      <description>I wish I could share my favorite tape. I wish I could even state what&amp;rsquo;s on the tape as well. But what&amp;rsquo;s life without secrets? I&amp;rsquo;ll take the USGOV approach. In 20 years it won&amp;rsquo;t matter so it will be the declassified tapes.
In the meantime I will share a gem I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget - Tommy Betts the man who mentored my dad in music, and my father. I&amp;rsquo;m playing some piano in the background, and the recorder I left on their table.</description>

      <description>Brian me and Miles went to a Poetry night in Marquette. 3 cousins! That&amp;rsquo;s a novel experience for me so it was quite exciting. Brian and I each spat a poem, and this is the only place that will have audio from that night. Brian is a good writer and him and him and I both share the schizo gene.

      <description>My dad and I went to checkout a guitar on craigslist today. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;instrumental&amp;rsquo; that we get a guitar on this trip, because the magic and emotions have been running high so far.
We had a great time with him, spent 20 minutes cracking jokes and BSing. Erik is hilarious. Towards the end of the transaction, Erik handed me the jacket seen in the picture above. It is my new favorite jacket, and I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating my next track to Erik.</description>

I learned a sure of a hell of a lot about the Betts family
Tommy Betts mentored my dad in guitar. Another relative said he came over to Tommy&amp;rsquo;s house one day and said to him at the door &amp;ldquo;Do you drink?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Do you fuck?&amp;rdquo;.

This morning was monumental. I met the most family members in my entire life. We hit the bar Flannigan&amp;rsquo;s ( right next door to the house my dad gew up in ) then the graveyard. That&amp;rsquo;s my grandparents graves on my dad&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

On a plane to Chicago with my dad. Then we&amp;rsquo;re catching a flight to Marquette, Michigan.
This flight is all about organizing my sound library, and sharing some secret sound.

      <description>Just jumped in the ocean and practiced handstands. This guy showed me how to go from your butt to a handstand There are different types of breathing.
 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.</description>

My cat died a few a couple months ago. It occurred around the time that %^&amp;amp;#$% broke up with me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about it since, but being home the past few days I was reminded how much I missed her. { The cat, not my X }

I&amp;rsquo;m pissed
real pissed. all I&amp;rsquo;ve got done today is 25 pushups / 50 confucious canooes / took my laptop apart. heading to the store for the second time with my dad to get a bunch of tiny star screwdrivers. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to get a kit of 1-10mm for this time and in the future.
Of the two meetings I scheduled with friends today, both forgot, and I should&amp;rsquo;ve completely been expecting that.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s this girl on the train. She has a nice SLR camera. For the past hour She&amp;rsquo;s been sneaking photos of people in the lounge car. She might&amp;rsquo;ve even gotten me, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.
I got her though  this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what key this is. I&amp;rsquo;m tone deaf.</description>

Since you&amp;rsquo;re constrained to the reality of our politics, biology, and paradigms; such as religion, capitalism, etc.
current state  I got the idea at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house, when I took an image of her sonogram and ran it through a max msp patch that converted the image data to MIDI.</description>

      <description>300 gigs of my own personal audio recordings. Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&amp;rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&amp;rsquo;t stop. Strong words have been tossed between friends and family, and every once in a while someone tries to speak against it.</description>

      <description>the center of github
 I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling.</description>

Had 1 beer @ [jack&amp;rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.</description>

      <description>I always wished I grew up in a household like this.

I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t start reading until you play this
A major client we have here has a major page down for their international (french site). I really had to shit and drink coffee so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t much help and now I should be working on fixing that, but am also consulting my buddy tyler on some flexbox use for a client of his.
Going to Michigan on Tuesday, so real quick notes, these things have to happen today -</description>

Every week at my work there&amp;rsquo;s an hour where you can share your projects / ideas over free coffee and snacks. I go for the free coffee and snacks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any new ideas but listening to all my unfinished beats.
// need to make more music

      <description>Bounce hour
Every week at my work there&amp;rsquo;s an hour where you can share your projects / ideas over free coffee and snacks. I go for the free coffee and snacks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any new ideas but listening to all my unfinished beats.
// need to make more music
 Yesterday I failed at making live loops because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have good old DJ Chad Mike hitting record for me.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to type anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sober for a full 7 days now, and I&amp;rsquo;m pissed. I am angry. I will use this anger to get shit done, like log work hours, work on music
Todd hooked me up big time at the fab lab, and I met Chris and Jordan. Chris Maddox printed the first versions of POLIWAT for me and I&amp;rsquo;m super amped on it.</description>

      <description>I dream in POLIWAT  Also my other account sound
I have been completely sober for 5 days Tuesday 952 PM
At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight. My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks.</description>

      <description>s&amp;mdash; title: &amp;ldquo;Tic For Tat&amp;rdquo; date: 2018-01-26T10:57:23-08:00
draft: false Friday 1057 AM
I can healthily say I&amp;rsquo;m disapointed in myself.
But I got great tape doing an interview with Mitch.
Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing Moxie.
The RULE that I learned fucking TWICE - don&amp;rsquo;t get high before interviews.
It&amp;rsquo;s only their graciousness that carries it.
So when I want something, I need to get in the habit of mentally postponing it,</description>
