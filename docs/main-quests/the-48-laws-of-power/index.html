<p><em>159 PM</em></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help myself. I want to draw. I want to be able to draw humans well, and quickly.</p>

<p>I have this book on anatomy drawing and I&rsquo;m going to bend the rules - this is helpful in drafting shots for poliwat I believe. But really I should specialize and focus only on the sound aspects, because that is already difficult enough. 20 minutes on drawing, I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>

<p><em>228 PM</em></p>

<p>Alright it looks like either my teensy 3.6 board is defective, or I burned it out on accident by running 4.5 volts into it&rsquo;s 3.3v power supply pin.</p>

<p>I have $183 to my name, and there&rsquo;s no choice but to purchase this.</p>

<p><em>619 pm</em></p>

<p>People think of sound progressing two dimensionally, like
notes on stalves, every representation of music is 2D. (how else could you do it?)
Well that influences how we write our music. Because our ears inclination in music moving forward is how we define music. Music can go any direction in a 3D grid thought. The orientation of a song, scale, or key to revolve around 16 as much as it revolves around 12. The music is happening 3 dimensionally, and the movement of the listener is not just forward like in more tradditional ideas of music (chord progressions) or backward, but also up or down. Moving throughout a sort of grid.</p>
