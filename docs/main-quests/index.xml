There&amp;rsquo;s a fat gap in the log right now. Moving to San Mateo has been a little life changing, and when life&amp;rsquo;s good I tend to not write as much. But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to hunker down and focus on a strong tracklist for the poliwat debut.

Enjoying the last night before a season of sobriety. This journals going to get lit.
Jack laid down the law over the phone earlier- I am to not piss his mom off, help clean out the garage, and do a list of chores. Oh and have a check ready for 200 bucks.</description>

      <description>listening to the new four tet album Who e=mc^2 I call when I&amp;rsquo;m depressed?
I woke up from 3 bad dreams on the trampoline. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling quite lonely. My dad is cursing and is angry about being late to work. The moment he comes home from his job he turns off and veggetizes. We rarely play music together.
Why should I feel depressed? I successfully launched two sites and applied to about 30 jobs yesterday.</description>

      <description>Thursday 1105AM
I have to have to be honest. Other than logging an audio trail, this diary is a tool for me to make better decisions. It was MONDAY when I started my portfolio site, and now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here and it&amp;rsquo;s late Thursday morning. I woke up on the trampoline falling asleep to Joe Rogon and Neil de Grasse Tyson. At about 1:20:50 Tyson talks about the importance of the naming of stuff, which clearly explains to me why the Illest Village project works.</description>

Today I can already feel. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a good day. I&amp;rsquo;ll mindlessly and endlessly produce. Today marks the day I need to empty this childhood bedroom of all my shit, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to move up to San Mateo.

      <description>Monday 1021 AM
Last night I planted some iceplant Paul gave me in my parents backyard. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to plant on the side.
This morning started with a quick look into Samuel Beckett and three Jays. JK, not marijuana but James Joyce, and Jane Austin.
Quick nugs from School of life and my own understanding:
Sammuel Beckett  likes to write around the word &#39;perhaps&#39; not specific, allowing viewer to make it specific on their own  James Joyce  Everyday losers are just as epic and interesting as rich / heroes / heroines.</description>

Just waking up. I ate my dad&amp;rsquo;s unfinished cereal with mangos, bananas, and strawberries in it.
The 7 Hermetic Principles  ‚ÄúTHE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAs above, so below; as below, so above.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúEverything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.</description>

      <description>Fri 617 PM
With my parental units, we are on our way to Bonnie&amp;rsquo;s Birthday dinner at a restaurant named Ember.
My parents watch master chef and eat mcdonalds.
So past 24 hours of poliwat venturing.
 Sean took me to his dad&amp;rsquo;s shop. We opened jars of screws and found enough for at least half the mounting brackets for the sliders / effects racks.   Borrowed a self-powered breadboard from Sean in order to diagnose LEDS, as well as two books on solid state electronics.</description>

I must admit here that I could be going faster. But I got distracted by the school of life&amp;rsquo;s art and Architecture educational videos on youtube.
Good design:[10]  is innovative ‚Äì The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</description>

 Poliwat master doc is getting an update.
1232 PM
Only listening to Bach because we share a birthday. Ate a quick tri-tip sandwich with a pickle, and made one for my mom.
Since today the world is ending, the only sane task at hand is to do what I love. I will build poliwat, and then travel the world with it. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple though because although the code compiles, I can&amp;rsquo;t get anything out of the LCD screen at the moment&amp;hellip;</description>

I have cut off all contact with everyone at this point. I will do the bare minimum communications. The only contact is with my parents here. Other than that I am entering complete isolation with myself and poliwat.
This week is devoted to building muscles, and not just physical.</description>

Woke up very depressed
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to move to San Mateo today. The plan is to start with getting a credit card at Wells Fargo, so I can rent the uhaul. You can&amp;rsquo;t rent a uhaul without a credit card. Then I just have to pack up whats in my room and head up there. But really I&amp;rsquo;d rather turn off my phone, keep my blinds shut, and work on poliwat.</description>

Dienrich&amp;rsquo;s diary
‚ÄúNowadays, the prevailing view is that you should authentically rejoice and celebrate the spiritual happiness that this era has to offer, for it is a gift! People need to think about how many challenges the world has faced and how many obstacles and dreadful dangers it has overcome. They no longer believe that it is temporal distance that embellishes things, persons and situations and what makes difficulties and problems fade away and be forgotten.</description>

      <description>I discovered one of the biggest thrills.
But first I will begin with the start of the night, at an old engineer type friend named Thomas from back in my Community College days. He held the BBQ at a house real close to one of the elementary schools I went to. It was interesting because I remember doing motocross as a kid with a friend that used to live there. There used to be a huge nice dirt motocross track in the backyard, but it had since been bulldozed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m broke because I stopped working my web development job over a month ago. I&amp;rsquo;m out of money. I&amp;rsquo;m on a spending freeze. Being home is useful for that.
We were joking the other night and Chad said a good one &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so broke my most broke friend said I was broke&amp;rdquo;
When you are this broke you can see price tags on all your possessions. I made a pact to sell anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t related to Poliwat.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mechanic humans do. I know I have Diahrea because once again I opened my day with an empty stomach and 3 cups of coffee. The stomach is no longer empty but I still have a black cup of coffee, right here with me on the toliet.</description>

The sound map in Google Earth is going well. I look forward to travelling and adding all audio logs as points, then you can hit play and watch audio trails.

Today I found out the real founder of 911 was blind, and he spent some time in New York.
Moving and cleaning the room Day 2, very deep in it.
Moving gives you an air of sentiment. There are great as well as painful memories, and they&amp;rsquo;re all treasured. The time capsule box has been selected and I have my items chosen to go inside, a fake degree Sean the provost handed me at graduation, and unopened Yoshi toy from Mcdonalds.</description>

      <description>502 pm
Captured memories is a main quest in Zelda. You need to find these 12(or 13?) lost memories across the expansive regions of the game.
Operation Captured Memories is the new official code name for the time capsule that we are burying at a graveyard in a couple weeks. So far this is what the box has:
 graduation certificiate from UCSC (which I&amp;rsquo;ll write a letter to my future self on) yoshi model from Mcdonalds little note I left for Tara (Jordan Lipaz&amp;rsquo;s GF) when I visited her trailer at the trailer park  &amp;lt;!</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s time to go back online. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sick since Monday, and still have a nasty cough. I feel weak and fat.
Going to retroactively share what happened on the off days, and finally work on poliwat.
My Zelda botw binge has been relentless. I love storming Ganon&amp;rsquo;s castle and hunting down lynels. I want to make a music video with actual gameplay on something.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting stuck on Ashley&amp;rsquo;s Photography work. I can&amp;rsquo;t look away! If she had a genre of photos I would call it sexy magic. She exploits the setting around these people to look much more attractive and magical than they&amp;rsquo;re probably treated. The hopeless romantic in me says the magic and beauty are already there, while she uses photography to show and remind others of it.
Future tracks will have track art from Ashley and will be notated as such.</description>

and a thought occurred to me what if my future love is able to read this?

      <description>Illest Village is the group name for the beats I make with Chad and Kevin, (also Chris and Sean when I see them).
We have so many beats we&amp;rsquo;ve made together, and this latest batch has shown some good progress. I only like one of these but the others were very fun to make with them :D

So I ordered a quick lyft, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my passport which serves a dual function as my wallet, and made it up to campus. Angel told me however that I was too late but she could get me in for a deep cleaning at noon.</description>

I lie in a pile of blankets on a sleeping bag in a white room furnished with only a music stand and a blue lightbulb hanging on the wall.

Tripping out to Slyvia&amp;rsquo;s voice currently. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. One of the last tracks on our first album as Jimmothy Leary. There&amp;rsquo;s about 10 tracks in my iTunes. James and I spent a lot of time yesterday bouncing tracks and figuring out the order of the album.</description>

      <description>it feels good  -16 days sober A quick analysis of an online journal. Currently there are less than 10 readers (the latest being a 71 year old woman) I&amp;rsquo;m finding that there are experiences that need to be documented, but are disadvantageous to write. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a good journal without the experiences that matter to me, so it&amp;rsquo;s a huge disservice to leave those experiences out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with simply hiding that content so I can find it at a later date easily but users won&amp;rsquo;t see it.</description>

 Stefan Jack and I skinny dipped in the ocean. There was a fisherman right next to us who got disgusted and left. We had a hilarious and exciting breakfast in Arcata. I haven&amp;rsquo;t recorded much on account of dead batteries after the ocean.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop.
I&amp;rsquo;m a slave. I&amp;rsquo;m a slave to the beat. The family reunion trip changed my mindset.</description>

      <description>Sunday 1134 AM A golden rule of writing is to choose specific over vague. The drunk shaman would not appreciate my sharing about them online so I will be vague. You are unstoppable when you have a drunken shaman.
Instead of talking about it I&amp;rsquo;m working on a track. This is the master doc for lyrics and iterations on the music.

song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m angry.

Chad said he was going to be home in 30 and we were going to walk the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs together. He never showed up and I&amp;rsquo;ve called 3 times. I&amp;rsquo;m very depressed.

      <description>My dad and I went to checkout a guitar on craigslist today. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;instrumental&amp;rsquo; that we get a guitar on this trip, because the magic and emotions have been running high so far.
We had a great time with him, spent 20 minutes cracking jokes and BSing. Erik is hilarious. Towards the end of the transaction, Erik handed me the jacket seen in the picture above. It is my new favorite jacket, and I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating my next track to Erik.</description>

I learned a sure of a hell of a lot about the Betts family
Tommy Betts mentored my dad in guitar. Another relative said he came over to Tommy&amp;rsquo;s house one day and said to him at the door &amp;ldquo;Do you drink?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Do you fuck?&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Homebrew Piano by Michael Betts Just jumped in the ocean and practiced handstands. This guy showed me how to go from your butt to a handstand There are different types of breathing.
 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.</description>

Since you&amp;rsquo;re constrained to the reality of our politics, biology, and paradigms; such as religion, capitalism, etc.
current state  I got the idea at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house, when I took an image of her sonogram and ran it through a max msp patch that converted the image data to MIDI.</description>

      <description>300 gigs of my own personal audio recordings.  ^ fav atm
Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&amp;rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&amp;rsquo;t stop.</description>

      <description>the center of github
 I have a romantic thought. What‚Äôs at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it‚Äôs stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven‚Äôt gone beyond doodling.</description>

Had 1 beer @ [jack&amp;rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.</description>

      <description>I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</description>
