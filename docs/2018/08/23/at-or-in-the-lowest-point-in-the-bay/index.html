<p>ok no more lying</p>

<p>had some spliff a few hours ago but not feeling it anymore. I feel a slight buzz off this coffee. Slept in simone&rsquo;s bed cause he&rsquo;s out of town at Hunter&rsquo;s place late last night - called darlene at like 1 am and talked to her for nearly an hour while skating to get a ham and cheese croissant, the first time after 5 attempts to get one at the local doughnut shop Ferrell&rsquo;s. Everyone here pronounces Ferrell&rsquo;s real white as if it&rsquo;s an animal inclined establishment. But I say it the correct way.</p>

<p>A concept in freestlying last night came about when I kept mentioning that urban dictionary is the least wrong dictionary for the english language.</p>

<p>=-=-= =-=-= =-=-= =-=-= =-=-= =-=-= =-=-=</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-orient-yourself">how do you orient yourself?</h2>

<p>I orient myself by establishing the context</p>

<p>back to the fundamental</p>

<p>who</p>

<p>wha</p>

<h3 id="aka-how-do-i-not-burn-out">aka how do I not burn out?</h3>

<p>I need to fix this problem with my head. I know I can do it in about 3 months, if I focus. All I need is a little help from my friends. I already admitted to Darlene I&rsquo;m trying to go sober but it&rsquo;s difficult. I love drugs, because they&rsquo;ve given me many unfathomable gifts. I don&rsquo;t feel 26, I feel older in a way.</p>

<p>Because one of the main reasons I see to do drugs is to live longer. I know that&rsquo;s counterintuitive, but it makes sense as an avid drug enthusiast for years.</p>

<p>For example, one time I just went for a piss while making music, and during the piss I had this crazy flashback of living the life of an aboriginal</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m highly sensitive and impressionable in a few ways. So just a taste, a hint of something and my imagination can on the regs take it to the extreme.</p>

<p>Because the ways I&rsquo;ve altered my mind, I feel like I&rsquo;ve lived a long time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 26, and I&rsquo;ve already talked to God twice.</p>

<p>I know my destiny at large</p>

<p>I know my general career trajectory</p>

<p>I have experience cosmic pussy, that&rsquo;s pussy so good it&rsquo;s a profound gift and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I go to hell or become handicapped, homeless, or a failure. I already experienced pussy so good that just to experience it once, is enough for a lifetime of joy. That&rsquo;s what cosmic pussy is to me, in this moment.</p>

<p>that feels like</p>

<p>gone into the yard a bit</p>

<p>down thought rabbit holes</p>

<p>down the chaotic system of consciousness</p>

<p>exploring consciousnes s</p>

<p>and just really observing different states of mind I can achieve, and the formula fr how to access them.</p>

<p>one day I&rsquo;d like to formalize these different contexts, I can think of about 4 off the top of my head right now.</p>

<p>For example, a modified version of what hypnotists do to their customers.</p>

<p>You can enter a calm meditative state where you can explore your subconsciousness a bit, and that&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s a little more succeeding.</p>

<p>I need to do a serious smoking tribute in order to quit smoking. I think I&rsquo;ll call it my last pack.</p>

<p>Anyways I hate to</p>

<pre><code>all good rappers steal

all good rappers cheat


good rappers make good thieves

good thieves minimize

grief

when they steal

I steal from no one

I'm bad at stealing
I'm bad at


whats easy now
will be difficult
you're difficult

im down cause I fail to meet your expectations
your down cause you made that the situation

I'm not reasonable
dont treat me like I am
dont expect me like I am
accept me as I am

ok ?

Sam ?
