<p><strong>Tuesday 1034 PM</strong></p>

<p>Monday</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 1141 PM</strong></p>

<p>Just hoped onto bart station at 14th.</p>

<p>Had a wonderful time with ted gus cam. They are too smart, too inspiring.
I love them. We are all recording on Saturday at the station! I&rsquo;m glad I just booked it :D.</p>

<p>Moving along, let&rsquo;s get back to this podcast meetup.<a href="https://congressionaldish.com/">Jen</a>, has a cluttered crazy evernote and she hires a VA to go through and turn into something useable for the website.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing all the right actions, wrongly. Very very wrong.</p>

<p>Also I thought the poliwat audio journal site was so new - while in reality it can be seen as an average tumblr.
I don&rsquo;t backspace nearly as much tho.</p>

<p>From now on I will listen to that article on soundcloud.
I need to define my genre I supposed too. I&rsquo;m getting good feedback on the show so far, what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Today I drove all the way to the station to get the audio - going to put it all online tomorrow. Maybe even tonight unless I phizz out :)</p>

<p>I bought some cigarillos cause I&rsquo;m trying this 1 meal a day thing.
And it worked the first two days, and has broken today. I had a second meal with Cam, we made the fanciest salad with #$%^&amp;$%^&amp;*  &hellip;.. who cares it was delicious.</p>

<p>We decided that the cashier at was french Canadian, and while checking out she would combine english and Spanish in the most mesmerizing way.
&lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s Best Groceries&rsquo; in downtown Oakland is a lie at best when it comes to food, but the people in there were gems. Plus the salad was bomb.</p>

<p>A 50 minute bart ride back to Milbrae and I&rsquo;m going to grab my car.</p>

<p>I snuck on again and should&rsquo;ve not swiped my card lol. Milbrae at night is easy to sneak off of though. It&rsquo;s fun, you get to know the stations and their varying degrees of difficulty for sneaking in.</p>

<p>Even on the day of the women&rsquo;s march, with all the padded security, I saw a few opportunities to sneak. If you were Aladin. I played it safe because it was the Women&rsquo;s March. You don&rsquo;t want to add any extra attention / tension / stress on employees on a day like that.</p>

<p>I can only hope I&rsquo;m getting better. I took one small puff and got the pefect amount of a low level intoxication. I was more focused on not being a crazy ass, as I have proven myself in the past with threes company.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading Carl Sagan&rsquo;s Pale Blue Dot. Paul keeps sending me Jordan Peterson videos.</p>

<p>Did I already say this? Did a random dance class at the Y two mornings ago and FUCKED UP MY BACK. omg. couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed this morning, it hurt too much. Plus I gotta buy coffee.</p>

<p>Pete&rsquo;s Dark Roast.</p>

<p>This week is going by quickly, and it&rsquo;s fairly obvious what I have to do tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tomorrow and Wednesday that is.</p>

<p>In short, the next two days are solely devoted to Finish Episode 1 and Launch Website.</p>

<p>Fuck me I need to read.
Bye</p>
