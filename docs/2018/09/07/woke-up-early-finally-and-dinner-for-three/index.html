<p><strong>Fridat 753 AM</strong></p>

<p>Is today the day I successfully block everything out? That I stay sober?</p>

<p>I spliffed with Chad yesterday</p>

<p>what happened to my brain? I can fix it with meditation.
I&rsquo;ll work on the pomodor time schedule today,
with these tasks</p>

<pre><code>I'm committed to no more commitments
I'm on my own time
everyone can suck it
and will in

go home christian attitudes if you know

no on knows I making a music video
just watch my video Im serious though



</code></pre>

<p><strong>Friday 927 AM</strong></p>

<p>Okay at least I haven&rsquo;t had alcohol in a while. Def need to start on a keto only diet today.</p>

<p>setting up the studio in the room. It&rsquo;s a little sad that I am already having withdrawals a bit- looks like I went a little too hard on the paint.</p>

<p>Speaking of exess uses of little i</p>

<p>think</p>

<pre><code>why

why my parents are plebs
and I never got over it
grover beach getting to crowded
so I hike
or die
cause everything in my life is
do or die
pay your dues
I tell myself
pay your dues
one day myself
will be able to

<p><strong>Frida 959 AM</strong></p>

<p>Today is the first day I&rsquo;m sober still this long. Lol it&rsquo;s only 10 AM . I&rsquo;m making a big deal out of it, I mean being awake for this long without doing some fix. I really grew to hate my house back up in SC - because something wouldn&rsquo;t work then I would get a second wind too early, cause we know it&rsquo;s all about that second wind around 5 pm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m organizing files and this time, it&rsquo;s going to work. I have minimal distractions here at my parents house. I spent the morning organizing files and while when I have to wait for my POS faptop - I have been setting up the studio here. I really wanna throw down on some more gretsch as a reward.</p>

<p>yesterday I spent most of the day helping chad with registering the salvage car title stuff. It didn&rsquo;t go that well and we left it at - in 2 day Tmobile will send me a list of all my phone call history, so that we can try and track down that guy that sold us the car.</p>

<p>I doubt we&rsquo;ll get in contact with him, and I doubt further that he will help us.</p>

<p>But anyways</p>

<p>will I always feel estranged from society? Cause that&rsquo;s all I know. But then there are so many times when that is simply not the case.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not eating yet because I want to go go keto but there is limited keto food in the kitchen. I think my food stamps re upped today so I wanna go shopping, but don&rsquo;t want to stop working here. So I think I&rsquo;ll fast and then try and go later tonight right before TJs closes.</p>

<p><strong>Fridat 1056 AM</strong></p>

<p>alright alright I got arcade working</p>

<p>got 40 gigs of shit off my laptop so it&rsquo;s running better</p>

<p>I started on a new Vault 36 master folder for sounds</p>

<p>which I&rsquo;ll then upload</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t talked to anyone back in SC</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m eloping by myself</p>

<p>just going to be sober in this white room with one whole wall as a mirror</p>

<p>and going to just go ham on churning out music videos.</p>

<p>the simpler the better. If I set parameters then I&rsquo;ll be able to go faster. but damn it&rsquo;s not just about that. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m going crazy honesty to god .</p>
