<p><strong>Tuesdat 553 PM</strong></p>

<p>@ mcdonalds and less drunk than I thought I&rsquo;d be at this point. I went on a mission to use all the pain in the house - revamping the studio. Bought kevin and I 4 locos - we&rsquo;re going to rap tonight. Chad isn&rsquo;t coming back today but might tomorrow. Knowing him he will stall one more day - he doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to deal with his mother&rsquo;s passing in his hometown. And I don&rsquo;t hold that against him - he&rsquo;s in oceanside with a bunch of cool people and the beach so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d rather be than at the house in the mourn town.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m worried though</p>

<p>and also astronomically sad.</p>

<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>

<p>not sure what the right move is, except for spending the last 20 dollars to my nam eon enough mcdonalds for a small family,
one I&rsquo;d surely have if my IQ was lower.</p>

<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to say anymore, I&rsquo;m just so fuckign pissed that she passed. This morning upon waking I was going through the latest AV I gnabbed and found her in one of my clips and she didn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>

<p>She answered the door last week while I was holding the camera and didn&rsquo;t mind that I was recording, in fact was encouraging in her demeanor. But I wasn&rsquo;t that time.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe that she died before Vic&rsquo;s passing.</p>

<p>and this all reminds me about that one wear sunscreen lecture from NYU I burned to CD years ago - he said to the graduating class something about how life is not a guarantee, and surprises blind side you on some tuesday afternoon or something. I&rsquo;m not quite sure I remember it.</p>

<p>But oh well there&rsquo;s a cutie here at mcDonalds and the bar is low - I&rsquo;ll finish this four loco I poured into a ginger kevita kombucha thing and ask her out the least creepy way possible.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s looking at me so I know it&rsquo;s going to be chill.</p>

<p>-=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-==-=-</p>

<p>In addition I brought 1 hard drive cable so I&rsquo;ll for sure pay off some sound library stuff.</p>

<p>god damn I need a change of pace.</p>

<pre><code>am I a loser ?

yeah but that's how you win right ?
</code></pre>

<pre><code>strangers
ask me the time

I know what strangers are asking
for when they prompt for time
I give them extra credit
existential ansers
they don't understand
am I right ?
am I wrong
to hang with those
less educated
to fuck with those less
instigated

am I doomed to hang in company
and be he only human who sees ?

no that's wrong cause I know what they
see and it comes out in preach
but their tongues are more blunt
so they never realize what they see
poor girl never did a choomie
so I cancelled date at movies
not enough happening for me
unless



half a tab met the mayor at midnight
30 minutes in
her husband wants me to cuck
she wants to give me the keys t the city
I tell her no I gotta chase
something pretty and they left 40 minutes ago
a good handicap
give it to me
cause I hate being always on top
peratory siempre nonstop
when you think this quick
this wit will kill me before
my son turn 30
and I call it as I see it
so I gotta say
son, sorry your dad liked climbing so much
now what poison do I prefer
a cianicde apple like allan turning
the gayest way to kill yourself
through smoking in bad company
legacy 1 good symphony
that's enough for me
haven't wrote it yet
let me write 1000 tracks
roll 1000 spliffs
fuck 1000 blacks
realease
free 1000 hacks
save 1000 crack
heads get head give

<p>what&rsquo;s the coolest thing about a journal?</p>

<p>the observance of the moment in that time and place. I&rsquo;m drunk at mcdonalds so I don&rsquo;t give a shit about either.</p>
