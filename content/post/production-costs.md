**Fridat 703 AM**

Didn't set my alarm cause I couldn't find it last night but woke up just now.

today is going to be a productive one -

I am going to be savage with my time today I can feel it.

big upload day in some ways.

burnt my food so drank a quart

```
bar is so low I just wanna sing
you suck you suck you suck you suck
but prefer to be more tactful with my verse
like in words of {}
  {}-quote
    you are {}
    when they {}

    I {strong verb}

bar is high
bar is high for my self of mind
bar is high for myself of mind 

```
