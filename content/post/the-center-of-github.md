the center of github

I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of [Github](https://github.com)?
I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.

My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling. But expectations have increased at my job, and I’m dealing with some rather large websites.

I’m not a good programmer. I write shitty code.
My 9-5 dream job is to make


A simple to DO list to finish github.center

1. Set tracklist

2. Title tracklist

3. create track art for each

4. Mix + Master each track

5. setup on bandcamp + soundcloud

6. setup git repo with stems of each track

7. create github.center site

8. Write blurb / link documentation / stems / sound / art for each track

9. setup patreon account for making music
