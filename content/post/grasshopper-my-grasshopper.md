Grasshopper my Grasshopper
I speak to you in total confidence in consequence
in pool go go girl went postal in my post office

be super nice cause most are lost
most are lonely
few are loud
I am loud
I am proud
I am a prohpet of my past predicated upon all my mistakes
if I love jimminy cricket spitting to crickets me mistakes
I spit to you my Grasshopper

I need a mentor
I need a guru
I need a mentor
I cannot take this

I cannot fake this no more
I cannot take this no more
I cannot work her no more

I cannot affirm my aspirations
by sharing with parents 


(I admit)
