#### I dream in POLIWAT

First off some [sound](https://soundcloud.com/github)

###### I have been completely sober for 5 days

*Tuesday 952 PM*

At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I'll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight.
My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks. Jack is coming from San Mateo to Santa Cruz tomorrow to work on the Sims Sims with me so I'll ask him to pick one up for me.

Stefan my roommate already said I could use his laptop for work tomorrow, so with my last battery I'll push this live and hopefully install git if I have enough time. But I won't have enough time. I'm working a lot at my job doing web development. I am a terrible programmer, and I have no business doing it. I'm trying to switch careers, so every hour after work I attempt to do something towards that. I'm starting a digital media company in the next month, and I want to make a living as an artist. Specifically in audio and video.

I'm coming back from a long weekend in my hometown, San Luis Obispo (SLO). I came down to film my pregnant sister for a music video. Stefan and I spent the last week working on the instrumental together, and we've been writing and recording vocals on it. The instrumental has taken a nice shape, but the words/flow need help and also the video needs some more editing. One of my best childhood friends and essentially little brother [Chad](http://chadlamon.com) helped film and he did a great job throwing a quick cut together.

In 7 days I'm going to Michigan for the first time in my life with my dad, for the most epic bonding experience ever. I say that because he grew up there, and I will meet a lot of family I've heard little about, for the first time. I hope my [snapchat](http://snapchat.com) glasses come in the mail first so I can document the trip well and in a low-profile way. I will for sure collect audio and post here.

This is my first online journal entry. I'm not a strong writer. But I have been journalling extensively since 2011, primarily in [evernote](http://evernote.com). My journals as of late have become much more schizo and unreadable lately, so my thought is that if I publish them online then


 1. Stay sober
 2. Finish POLIWAT rig v1
 3. Start company
 4. git init 6pack

*Everyday spent not making music is a day wasted*.
