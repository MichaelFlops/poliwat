*Bounce hour*

Every week at my work there's an hour where you can share your projects / ideas over free coffee and snacks. I go for the free coffee and snacks.

I don't have any new ideas but listening to all my unfinished [beats](https://soundcloud.com/github).

// need to make more music

Yesterday I failed at making [live loops](https://youtu.be/0gKWfvd-chA) because I didn't have good old [DJ Chad Mike](https;//chadlamon.com) hitting record for me. The more I program, write, solder, the worse I get at being a musician.
Yesterday I was dead sober and couldn't even properly loop a 2 chord progression. BUT the settings on the looper were fucked up it was on quantize while recording so playback was *nothing* like what it should've sounded like. Today after work [stefan](http://soundcloud.com/kyotokidforever) and I are going to play together practicing live looping. But I also need to start wiring this bad boy up:

Umm I have goals now

I'm going to drop an album in the next week? Depending on if I can get my laptop fixed in time. Need to mix and master a few of the tracks.



sitting is the new smoking


standing desk


eaach track for the github album will be titled a git command, and it will link to the documentation
That's kind of hilarious, then you can play the track when you successfully run some of these commands
it's a fun idea to make an instrumental for each of these tracks as Well



*239 pm thursday*
Just got back from lunch with boss.
Currently shitting in a bathroom, going to brush my teeth after.

I can feel myself getting a little more courage blogging. Journalling is more like it. Blogs are fucking retarded.
Online journalling scares me. No one has read a single sentence thus far.

Current Accountabilibuddies:

1. [Chad](http://chadlamon.com/) mike have a pact to do 100 pushups a day.
2. [stefan](http://soundcloud.com/kyotokidforever) mike have a pact to remain sober (he can do as he pleases, he makes sure I don't consume alcohol / nicotine / marijuana ).
3. [tyler](https://github.com/prudentbot) mike have a pact to do something that scares you each day.


Today I brought a little stretch band to work and I'm going to book a meeting room so I can workout while looking over these jira tickets. There are too many tickets, I'm overwhelmed, I'm a terrible programmer, and I need to get better at just about everything. I need to focus.

*sober for 8 days*

```
I feel like a total junkie
my junkiness is complex
I'm a junkie connoisseur
```
There are events and choices that have happened today and in the past few days that I won't mention because this is an online journal. What scares me is sharing. But with being vulnerable comes great power. So for the sake of tyler mike I will share one of those things.
