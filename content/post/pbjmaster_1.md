Friday 10:31 AM

A major client we have here has a major page down for their international (french site).
I really had to shit and drink coffee so I wasn't much help and now I should be working on fixing that, but am also consulting my buddy tyler on some flexbox use for a client of his.

Going to Michigan on Tuesday, so real quick notes, these things have to happen today -

1. Get Driver's License at the DMV
2. Logout of everything on this computer, give back to Stefan by 4 pm
3. Fix my laptop if the new charging port came in the mail
4. Pack for catching train tomorrow for hometown/michigan
4. Jump on public transit to meet Jack, work on the Sims Sims and hopefully meetup with


ON TRAIN BEFORE I FORGETO:

*business wirteup to explain poliwat to chad, meeting Sunday 2-4pm*
*organize sound library, start building sample kits for poliwat*

1134 am
working but UpDATE, Poliwat last night officailly became a squad. My roommate and most recent BFF Stefan told me he's down to join.
