I took the day off and went sailing with my friend

My mindset has completely changed. I'm young. I'm going to do the stupid unsafe thing for a while. I'll survive. And if I don't there will be a catalog of working documenting my journey. It's all about making tracks based off audio collected from the day.

Chris and I sampled his boat, we call it the old gwen drum kit ahahahaha.

I grew a new appreciation for the ocean, from a wind perspective. In sailing you have fewer options. If you want to hit a certain point, you can use tacking.
